    <div id="project-description">
      <p>With the emergence of COVID-19 2019, work sprawled out of our
computers into our homes. The home, as yet seen as a one’s individual
place of shelter and refuge, has transformed into a heterogenous “in-between-
space” — fusing work with leisure, business with private. Although
working remotely inherits a certain privilege in times like these, it also
brought massive changes to our personal environments. These blurred
lines, require for a redefinition of our understanding of professionalism and
rise questions around its origin. What is the new standard for professionalism
if it doesn’t manifest itself in the self-contained workspace anymore?
The change of location is key for leaving the private self at home and getting
into character of the “full blood professional”. Without this transition time,
the boundaries between private and professional self are fluid and undistinguishable.
Lockdown Commute addresses this lack of spacial shift and
provides a method to reassert the sacredness of professionalism within the
home office.The performative nature aims to comment on today’s tendency
towards solutionhalism and liberates its user from self imposed and briefed
notions of professionalism.
